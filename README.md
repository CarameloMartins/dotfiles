# dotfiles

This repo is a collection of my dotfiles, inspired by [GitHub ‚ù§ ~/](https://dotfiles.github.io/) and similar resources.

## Requirements

- stow
- git

## Instructions

- Run `stow -t $HOME .`.
- `git` - This will set global `.gitconfig` and `.gitignore` files. For privacy, email and user should be set in another file (`~/.gitconfig.id)` and will be included in the configuration.
- Execute `:PlugInstall` in `vim`.

## Resources

[dotfiles.github.com](http://dotfiles.github.com) and all the contributors referenced
in that page along with all dotfiles repos in [github.com](http://github.com) were my
main sources of inspiration and reference.

Along with stolen scripts from
[stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) whenever necessary that are mentioned inside the scripts.
